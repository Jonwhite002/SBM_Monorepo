# Autogenerated CAN interface Library

This repository will automatically generate the .c and .h files needed for packing and unpacking can bus Messages. This will be useful for embedding this code. Slower, but easier tools are avaialble for post processing. 

At every push, a Github Action will fire, checking if any files in the dbc directory have changed. If they have, it will run and overwrite the output in the can_conv directory. It will then commit the changes. 

The underlying code used for the conversion can be seen [here](https://github.com/howerj/dbcc#dbc-convertercompiler). Please note the restriction on 8 byte. I think the 8-bites noted on the first paragraph is supposed to be bytes. 

This can be used as a submodule or as ZIP library or manually dragged in. In any case, it removes the manual operation.
